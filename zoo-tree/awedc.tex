Also called ``Automata With Equality and Disequality Constraints'' (AWEDC),
this class of automata augments regular tree automata with the ability to
require (dis)equality of positions in accepted trees, using local
constraints.  In general, the configuration space of these machines is
$\config = \mathcal{Q} \times \mathcal{T}(\Sigma)$ for states $\mathcal{Q}$
and input alphabet $\Sigma$; however, $\delta$ is constrained as outlined in
\autoref{sec:treeaut:con:loc} to only perform comparisons within the tree
structure; it may not compare against external trees.  The automata is
accepting when the root node of a run is labeled by a configuration whose
first component is in a set of accepting states, $\mathcal{Q}_f$.  See
\cite[Sec 4.2]{tata} for details.
