Tree Automata with Global Equality and Disequality (TAGED) were introduced
by \cite{filiot:sltv} and further results were published in
\cite{filiot:tagc}.  A TAGED automaton is a regular tree automaton (with
state set $\sts$) together with two relations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $=_A \subset \sts^2$ reflexive and symmetric,
  \item $\neq_A \subseteq \sts^2$ irreflexive and symmetric.
\end{itemize}
A run $r$ of a TAGED automaton is a run of the underlying regular automaton
which additionally satisfies, for all positions $p$ and $p'$ in the run,
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\lab{r|_p} =_A    \lab{r|_{p'}} \Rightarrow \tr{r|_p} = \tr{r|_{p'}}$,
  \item $\lab{r|_p} \neq_A \lab{r|_{p'}} \Rightarrow \tr{r|_p} \neq \tr{r|_{p'}}$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Sub-classes} Polarized forms (``positive'' and ``negative'') are
also defined as TAGED automata without disequalities (resp. equalities).  A
``vertically bounded'' TAGED is an automaton in which there is a static
bound on the number of globally-disequal states on each root-to-leaf path.
